This is a chat gemma backend and font end  inside the folder, it is a FLASK rules to keep folder there. an static folder for css and images otherwise it wont be working
Model gemma was fine tuned on data about Marek Augustyn and his projects
Just activate .backend virtual env and start front end with the chat, wai a few seconds.

Question you should ask:
Tell me about Marek Augustyn and his projects.
or 
Is Marek Augustyn software developer

IMPORTANT:

When you run server using FLASK only then chat is faster it use MPS
If you use Unicorn then is slower, error with graphics card
I could not run server on M1 because of the firewall block a por 5001 and If you turn off all fireworks and turn on option in the router to allows all connection then is not safe.
I do not know solution yet

Start app. It is Flask web app to run activate virtual env and use flask(local) or gunicorn (server external)

Activate Virtual Env .backendChatGemmaAppVenv:

source .backendChatGemmaAppVenv/bin/activate


Start your Gunicorn server again with the increased timeout:
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 app:app --workers 1 --timeout 120 (or whatever higher timeout you found works).


If you wanna run flask just rub program: python app.py it should start local server

When you want to acces form the other device in local network then use ip komputer that is running server so: http://192.168.1.10:5001

You've provided your app.py code, and it's helpful to see the with app.app_context(): load_model() block. This explains why it works locally without load_model() explicitly before app.run().

The with app.app_context(): load_model() pattern loads the model when the Flask application context is initialized, which happens when app.run() is called. This is a valid way to load resources that need the app context.

However, when you move to a production-grade server like Gunicorn (which you must do for external visibility), the execution flow changes slightly. Gunicorn doesn't directly call app.run(); it imports your app object.

Here's how to modify your app.py and the command to make it visible from the outside world, focusing on the safest and most common practices:

1. Critical app.run() Change (for development server testing only)
To test basic external visibility (e.g., from another device on your local network), you need to tell Flask's development server to listen on all network interfaces.

Change in app.py:

Python

# ... (your existing code) ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Make sure to set debug=True only for development, not production
    # Change host to '0.0.0.0' to listen on all available network interfaces
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True, port=5000)
Why it froze previously: It's possible that when you tried app.run(host='0.0.0.0') before, your load_model() wasn't in an app_context, or there was another issue. With the with app.app_context(): load_model() block, it should now load correctly even with host='0.0.0.0'.

WARNING: As reiterated multiple times, debug=True is NEVER for production. It allows arbitrary code execution. Use this only for local network testing.

2. The Correct Way for External Visibility: Gunicorn
For a server visible from the outside world, you must use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn. This handles multi-threading/processing, robust request handling, and is far more secure.

First, ensure Gunicorn is installed:

Bash

pip install gunicorn
Next, remove or comment out the if __name__ == "__main__": block from your app.py entirely, or at least modify it not to call app.run() for production.

Your app.py (Final Structure for Gunicorn Deployment):

Python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
from flask_cors import CORS
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from peft import AutoPeftModelForCausalLM
import torch
import os # Import os for path handling

# Determine the device globally
device = torch.device("mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

# Define the absolute path to your frontend folder (assuming a specific structure)
# If app.py is in 'my_gemma_chat_app_backend/' and frontend is in 'my_gemma_chat_app_frontend/'
# Corrected static_folder path for a separate frontend project
basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
frontend_folder_path = os.path.join(basedir, '..', 'my_gemma_chat_app_frontend') # Adjust 'my_gemma_chat_app_frontend' if your actual folder name is different

app = Flask(__name__, static_folder=frontend_folder_path) # Point static_folder to the frontend root
CORS(app) # Initialize CORS for your app

MODEL_PATH = os.path.join(basedir, "gemma_2b_finetuned_v2", "final_checkpoint") # Use os.path.join for robust path
# If gemma_2b_finetuned_v2 is inside your backend project, this path is correct.
# Otherwise, adjust basedir to point to its parent or an absolute path.

tokenizer = None
model = None

def load_model():
    global tokenizer, model
    print(f"Loading model from {MODEL_PATH}...")

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)
    model = AutoPeftModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
        MODEL_PATH,
        torch_dtype=torch.float16,
        device_map="auto",
    )
    model.to(device)
    print(f"Model loaded to device: {device}")
    model.config.use_cache = True
    model.eval()
    print("Model loaded successfully!")

# Load model when the application starts up
# This block runs when gunicorn imports your 'app' object
# No need for with app.app_context() here when running with Gunicorn,
# as the model should be loaded as part of the module's initialization
# if it's needed immediately upon app start.
# However, if you have specific Flask context dependent operations,
# then `with app.app_context():` is correct for those.
# For model loading, generally just putting it outside functions is fine or calling it directly.

load_model() # <--- Move this directly after model/tokenizer globals

def serve_index():
    # Make sure 'index.html' is directly in your static_folder (my_gemma_chat_app_frontend)

def serve_static_files(filename):
    # Security: Ensure the requested file is within the static directory.
    # send_from_directory handles this mostly, but good to be explicit.
    if os.path.exists(os.path.join(app.static_folder, filename)):
        return send_from_directory(app.static_folder, filename)
    else:
        # For a Single Page Application, you might want to redirect to index.html

        return "File not found", 404

def chat():
    user_question = request.json.get("question")
    if not user_question:

    prompt = f"<bos><start_of_turn>user\n{user_question}<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n"

    try:
        inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model.generate(
                **inputs,
                max_new_tokens=60, # Adjust as needed
                do_sample=False,   # Set to False for deterministic output, or True for creative
                temperature=0.7,

# Remove the __main__ block if using Gunicorn for deployment.
# If you keep it, ensure app.run() is NOT called when Gunicorn is running.
# For local development without Gunicorn, you would still use this:
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     # Debug mode is DANGEROUS for public-facing servers. Use only for local dev.
#     app.run(host='0.0.0.0', debug=True, port=5000)

Explanation of changes:

load_model() call: I moved load_model() to directly after the global tokenizer and model declarations. When Gunicorn starts, it imports your app.py module. Code at the top level (outside functions or if __name__ == "__main__":) gets executed immediately during import. This ensures your model is loaded before Gunicorn starts accepting requests. The with app.app_context(): is more crucial if you were using Flask-specific extensions that must have an app context to initialize, but for just loading transformers models, direct invocation is fine.

os.path for robust paths: Using os.path.join and os.path.abspath makes your path handling more robust across different operating systems.

Removal of if __name__ == "__main__": app.run(): This block is specifically for the Flask development server. When using Gunicorn, you launch your app with the gunicorn command, which directly imports your app object.

How to Run with Gunicorn for External Access:
Activate your virtual environment.

Navigate to your backend directory where app.py resides.

Run Gunicorn:

Bash

gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app --workers 1 # Using 1 worker due to GPU model
--bind 0.0.0.0:5000: This tells Gunicorn to listen on port 5000 on all available network interfaces.

app:app: The first app is the Python module name (app.py), and the second app is the Flask application instance variable within that module (app = Flask(...)).

--workers 1: This is important for GPU-backed models. If you use multiple Gunicorn workers, they will all try to load the model onto the same GPU, leading to out-of-memory errors or significant performance degradation. One worker is sufficient for a single GPU model.

Next Steps (Networking and Security - Repeat as necessary!):
Once your Gunicorn server is running correctly with the 0.0.0.0 bind:

Find your M1 Mac's Local IP Address: (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

Configure Port Forwarding on Your Router:

Log in to your router's admin panel (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).

Find "Port Forwarding", "NAT", or "Virtual Servers" settings.

Create a rule to forward an External Port (e.g., 8000) to your Internal IP Address (your Mac's local IP) on the Internal Port (5000). Protocol: TCP.

Find your Home's Public IP Address: Use whatismyip.com.

Test from Outside Your Network: On a device connected to cellular data, open http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:EXTERNAL_PORT (e.g., http://123.45.67.89:8000).

Remember the security warnings from my previous response. Exposing a server (especially a development-mode Flask server) to the internet is risky. Gunicorn helps, but it's still your responsibility to secure your network and application.



Use this increase time for load:
Start Server using this command
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 app:app --workers 1 --timeout 120

Activate DMZ if no connection. Not too long expose computer for viruses attack




Close DMZ and forward ports
ou also said: "I still have DMZ open".

This is a severe security risk that must be addressed immediately. Even if the server appears stable now, having DMZ enabled exposes your entire Mac to the internet without any protective firewall. Any vulnerability in your operating system or other software could be exploited.

It is absolutely crucial to disable DMZ on your router.

Recap of the Secure Setup (and why you need it):
Disable DMZ on your router. This closes all ports on your Mac to the internet except those explicitly allowed by port forwarding.

Ensure your macOS Firewall is ON. This is your primary line of defense on the Mac itself.

Add an explicit firewall exception for your Python/Gunicorn application on port 5001. This allows only the Gunicorn process to receive incoming connections on port 5001, while everything else remains blocked by the firewall.

Set up a precise Port Forwarding Rule on your router:

External Port: 8000 (or 8080, or 50000, etc. - pick one you want public users to use).

Internal Port: 5001 (This is where your Gunicorn server is actually listening).

Internal IP Address: Your Mac's static local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

Why this specific setup is necessary:
Security: This configuration creates a narrow, controlled tunnel for your server traffic, minimizing your exposure to internet threats. DMZ is like leaving your front door and all your windows wide open; proper port forwarding is like having a sturdy front door and only unlocking a specific window when a specific delivery is expected.

Clarity: It clearly defines which external port maps to which internal port and internal device, making troubleshooting easier in the future.

What to do now:
Stop your Gunicorn server.

Go to your router's administration page.

Find the DMZ setting and DISABLE IT. Apply/Save changes.

Find the Port Forwarding (or NAT, Virtual Servers) section.

Create or verify the port forwarding rule as described above:

External Port: 8000 (or your chosen public port)

Internal Port: 5001

Internal IP Address: Your Mac's static local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

Protocol: TCP (or Both)

Ensure the rule is ENABLED and SAVE/APPLY the changes. Reboot your router.

On your Mac, ensure your macOS Firewall is ON and that you've added the explicit exception for your python or gunicorn executable to allow incoming connections on port 5001.

Start your Gunicorn server again with the increased timeout:
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 app:app --workers 1 --timeout 120 (or whatever higher timeout you found works).

Test from an external network (phone on mobile data) using your public IP and the EXTERNAL port you configured: http://86.46.205.2:8000 (if 8000 is your external port).

You've made tremendous progress. Please take this last step to secure your setup.

add to firewall exception:
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /Users/marek/Programowanie/my_gemma_chat_app_backend/.backendChatGemmaAppVenv/bin/python
